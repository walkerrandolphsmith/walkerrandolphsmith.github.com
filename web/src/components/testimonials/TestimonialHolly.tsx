        I had the pleasure of working with Walker, and he consistently impressed
        me with his drive, creativity, and deep technical skill. He brought
        innovative thinking to every challenge and was a true partner to
        UXâ€”thoughtful, open, and always focused on building the best experience
        for users. A standout collaborator and someone I&apos;d gladly work with
        again.
