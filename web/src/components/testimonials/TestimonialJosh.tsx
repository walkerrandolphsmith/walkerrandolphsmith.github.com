        I had the pleasure of working with Walker Smith at VersionOne (now
        Digital.ai). While I was in sales and he was a software engineer, we
        collaborated regularly to bring customer feedback into the product
        development process. Walker was always open to listening and was quick
        to turn real-world input into real improvements.

      <p className="indent-8">
        From what I saw and heard from others on the team, Walker made a huge
        impact on the engineering side. He helped modernize our tech stack,
        improved developer efficiency, and built features that truly mattered to
        our customersâ€”like webhooks for enterprise integrations and automated
        testing that saved hundreds of hours per release.

        He also stood out as a strong mentor and{' '}

        , helping teammates grow their skills and pushing for best practices
        across teams. Any organization would benefit from having Walker on their
        team.
