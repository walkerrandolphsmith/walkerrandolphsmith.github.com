        Calling Walker a standout engineer only begins to capture the depth of
        his impact. During our time working together at Microsoft, I was
        consistently impressed by his ability to balance long-term engineering
        strategy with near-term execution. His strong technical vision enabled
        him to drive system-level improvements that raised the bar on our
        group&apos;s architecture as a whole, while simultaneously keeping
        feature delivery on track, sprint after sprint.

        But Walker&apos;s strengths go well beyond the technical.{' '}

          He leads

        with an intuitive grasp of team dynamics, fostering an environment where
        others can do their best work. Collaborating with him wasn&apos;t just
        productive â€“ it was genuinely inspiring, and a highlight of my time at
        Microsoft.

        Walker is the kind of developer whose presence consistently elevates any
        team he&apos;s a part of. It was a privilege to work with him, and I
        wouldn&apos;t hesitate to do so again if given the opportunity.
